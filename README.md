# UDP-Socket-Client-Server
This project features the development of a UDP (User Datagram Protocol) based client-server system using Java. It emphasises a connectionless communication method, contrasting with the more common TCP-based systems. The core components of this project are two Java classes: UDPServer.java and UDPClient.java.
